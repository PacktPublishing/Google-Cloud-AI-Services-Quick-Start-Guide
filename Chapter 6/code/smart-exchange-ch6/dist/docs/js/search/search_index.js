Angular and Express files are being watched. Any change automatically creates a new bundle, restart Express server and reload your browser.\nAngular CLI\nYou can use Angular CLI generate functions as you would do in any Angular project. Use\n$ ng generate component home --module appRefer angular/angular-cli Wiki for more information.\nProduction mode\nnpm run prod: run the project with a production bundle and AOT compilation listening at localhost:3000 \nBuild project for deployment\n\nDevelop the app\nnpm run build\nThe output will be store in dist folder present at the root of the project.\nThis folder can now be

deploy code to Heroku, make the required changes and commit your files\nRun git push heroku master\nTo open the app heroku run\n\nRunning frontend unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning frontend end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor. \nBefore running the tests make sure you are serving the app via npm start.\nRunning backend tests\nRun mongod to run an instance of MongoDB, then run npm run testbe to execute the backend tests via Mocha.\nRunning TSLint\nRun ng lint (frontend) and npm run lintbe (backend) to execute the
